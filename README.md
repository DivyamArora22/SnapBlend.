# SnapBlend-Project

The decision to create pre-existing and custom Snapchat filters was a result of us wanting to pursue a project that explores computer vision techniques as well as staying relevant to the cultural impact of these technologies. We were able to gain hands-on learning experience with creative expression and technical innovation. By recreating popular Snapchat filters as well as creating our own, we were able to show that accessibility for this type of creative expression is feasible and easy to use. Looking at this project high-level, we are able to mold our perspective and choices by immersing ourselves in this digital environment. This project has provided us with an avenue for visual expression and reimagination, showcasing the future of cultural expression in the digital age.
